# TO-DO
- Configure devise for production: "in production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application"
- Select 2 - 3 Google fonts for website headers, text, buttons, and title texts
- Address devise error messages - can we highlight the input fields instead of generating a giant alert block? If not then consider relocating error messages to the right side of the view's `container` div.
- Style Forgotten Password devise view
- Install LetterOpener to view and style application emails
- Create User posts: Post, PartyFinder, PartyBoard, GuildRecruitment

# Important TO-DO
- `class_specialization.js` is included on every view, can we only include it on the pages that utilize it? Research `javascript_pack_tag` and how to use it.

# On-going
- Utilize FactoryGirl & rspec to create comprehensive tests
